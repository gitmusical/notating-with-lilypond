# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to a course on GitHub Learning Lab! :robot: :heart: :balloon: 

Every Learning Lab consists of two repositories:
- **a course repository** containing the bot code and responses 
- **a template repository** containing the starter code for the hands-on project

Most community contributions begin in the course repository.

### Ways to contribute

We love contributions from the community. Here are just a few of the ways you can contribute:

- **Report bugs:** if you find a bug while taking a Learning Lab course, you may want to do a quick check of past issues in the course repository to see if you can find any help there. Otherwise, create a new bug issue in the course repository using the provided template. 
- **Answer questions:** check out the open issues in the course repository to see if you can help answer learner questions. Learners also ask questions in the [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Learning-Lab/bd-p/learn)
- **Suggest changes:** this could come in the form of a new learning outcome, updates to the content, updates to the bot responses, or the logic of the course. If you'd like, you can fork the course and suggest the change that way, but most people like to talk about it first in an issue.
- **Tackle an issue:** if you see an issue you would like to resolve, please feel free to fork the course and submit a PR (check out the instructions below).
- **Translate a course:** if you have the ability to translate a course, we'd love to see it. Please fork the course and submit a PR. We'll need a second native speaker to confirm the translation so if you have anyone in mind, please @ mention them in your PR for a review.

### What should I know before I get started?

You'll want to learn more about how Learning Lab works and courses are structured. To get up to speed, use the following resources:
- take the course: [_Write a Learning Lab course_](https://lab.github.com/github/write-a-learning-lab-course)
- read the [documentation on writing a course](https://lab.github.com/docs/writing-quickstart)
- watch the [video on how a Learning Lab course works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaLSVcwFkiI&list=PLg7s6cbtAD147DXcVp899Fk6SegoLY9gL&index=4)

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the course repository AND the template repository.
1. In order to test your changes, you'll need to create your own draft version of the course on Learning Lab. You'll need to:
   - Install Learning Lab on both the course repository and the template repository
   - Go to `https://lab.github.com/{{ your-username }}/new` and provide the slug for the course repository
   - This will create a **draft** course. You can do all of the testing while in draft, you won't need to publish the course
1. Once you've created the draft version, you can use the Course Builder to make changes. For more information on how to make changes, check out the [documentation](https://lab.github.com/docs/writing-quickstart) 
1. Commit your changes to your branch
1. Open a pull request in the parent repository with:
    - base branch: the master branch of the course repository
    - compare branch: the branch containing your commits in your fork
1. Request a review from the Learning Lab team (this should be automatically requested)

# Chords with LilyPond

Nice job with the time signature! What do you notice about the barlines? If you'd like to listen before we move on to the next step, here's how:

### Chords

You may have noticed so far that our example has many instances of only one note, but there is an example of a chord.

Single notes are notated by letters (or letters combined with numbers or other symbols) that are surrounded by spaces, like:

```ly
  c8\mf c g' b
```

Below, you can see that the notes `G` and `D` are grouped together by the bracket symbols, `<` and `>`:

```ly
  a a <g d>4
```

## Step 4: Create a chord

Let's add another chord to the last note of the piece!

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a chord on the last note with C and the G below it

3. Save and commit your changes to this branch

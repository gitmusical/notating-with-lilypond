I wasn't able to find that you added the proper key signature!

I'm specifically looking for the following line:

```ly
... {
  \key c \minor
  
  ...
}
```

Note: the ellipses (`...`) are just placeholders for areas that this section doesn't focus on. Do not copy and paste the ellipses into your code.

I'll respond when I detect a new commit on this branch.

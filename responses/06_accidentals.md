# Accidentals

Nice work! If you'd like to listen before we move on to the next step, here's how:

### Accidentals on LilyPond

If you chose to visualize the changes as music notation after you changed the key signature, you may have noticed that the notes affected were automatically notated as naturals.

To change how these notes are visualized, we will add the notation for flats by the notes that we want to actually be flat.

**Flats** are notated with `es` after a note, like `ces` for cb.

**Sharps** are notated with `is` after a note, like `cis` for c#.

Naturals are always assumed.

## Step 6: Add an accidental

Let's make the _second_ `a` in the piece a _flat_.
